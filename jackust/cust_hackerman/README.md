  We used flutter sdk and dart as our main language
  Currently, we only developed the UI, display of information and the image searching function due to the limited time.
  We planned to develop a webpage and app.
  
  main.dart only list the initial home page

  foodcard.dart shows the "card" face of the food, where the "more" button helps navigate to the food page (currently foodtemplate2.dart), will modify later
  main.dart contains: the image picker button and textfield (for filtering chinese character)
  
  routegenerator.dart organise all the page routes
  
  foodtemplate2.dart is the detail page for each food
  
  restaurant_page.dart shows the lists of food from the type of restaurant
  
  image_search.dart is the page for user to select image from the local devices and show on the screen
